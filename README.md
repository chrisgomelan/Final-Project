![Design preview for the Frontpage section of Syntax Identification Game](/image/Frontpage.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out our final project in Computer Programming 2

**To play this game, you need a basic understanding of C++ and also if you want to practice your syntax skills in C++.**

## Objective 
The C++ Syntax Challenge is designed to help you practice and improve your C++ syntax skills. It presents you with various coding scenarios, and your task is to identify correctly the C++ syntax to solve each problem.

## How to Play:
When you start the game, you need to input your name. And after that, it will displayed the mechanics and you will proceed in choosing the difficulty level that suits your skill level and preference.

Here are the available difficulty levels:

- Easy - In the easy mode, you will be presented with a total of 6 questions to test your understanding of basic C++ syntax. The questions will cover topics like variable declarations, array declarations, pointers, and I/O syntax.

- Medium - If you choose the medium mode, you will face 5 slightly more challenging questions that will require a deeper understanding of C++ syntax. The topics covered may include conditional statements, creating alias name, loop, and more complex functions.

- Hard - For those seeking a real challenge, the hard mode offers 5 difficult questions that will put your advanced C++ syntax knowledge to the test. Expect questions related to unions, file handling, structures, and other advanced concepts.

**Attempts:**</br>
The game provides you with three attempts for each question. If you answer correctly on your first try, you'll receive a (1) point for that question. However, if your initial attempt is incorrect, you can try twice more to get the correct answer. Keep in mind that you will not lose points for wrong answers, but multiple attempts may affect your final score.

**Scoring:**</br>
Each correct answer will earn you points. The score will be calculated based on the number of questions you answered correctly within the chosen difficulty level.

**Finishing the Game:** </br>
After completing all the questions in the chosen difficulty level or exhausting your attempts, the game will display your final score.
After the game ends, you will have the option to play again and select a different difficulty level.


**TAKE NOTE** </br>
There is no time limit for answering the questions, so feel free to take your time and think through each scenario carefully. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced programmer wanting to sharpen your skills, this challenge is designed to be both fun and educational.
