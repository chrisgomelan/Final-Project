## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out our final project in Computer Programming 2

**To play this game, you need a basic understanding of C++ and also if you want to practice your syntax skills in C++.**

## Objective 
The C++ Syntax Challenge is designed to help you practice and improve your C++ syntax skills. It presents you with various coding scenarios, and your task is to provide the correct C++ syntax to solve each problem.

## How to Play:
Before we begin, you need to input your name and choose the difficulty level that suits your skill level and preference.

Here are the available difficulty levels:

- Easy - In the easy mode, you will be presented with a total of 6 questions to test your understanding of basic C++ syntax. The questions will cover topics like variable declarations, array declarations, pointers, and I/O syntax.

- Medium - If you choose the medium mode, you will face 5 slightly more challenging questions that will require a deeper understanding of C++ syntax. The topics covered may include conditional statements, creating alias name, loop, and more complex functions.

- Hard - For those seeking a real challenge, the hard mode offers 5 difficult questions that will put your advanced C++ syntax knowledge to the test. Expect questions related to unions, file handling, structures, and other advanced concepts.

**Scoring:**
Each correct answer will earn you points. The score will be calculated based on the number of questions you answered correctly within the chosen difficulty level.
